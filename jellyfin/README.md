Software Media System

[Website](https://jellyfin.org/)

I use it exclusively for video, for audio I prefer to use a stand-alone app Navidrome, just because I didn't knew great clients starting out. Now I found my Navidrome clients work just as fine with the Navidrome clients, but I still prefer it's webinterface because it's purposely created for music streaming.

## Clients

* Android: [Symfonium](https://www.symfonium.app/)
* PC (Linux/Windows/Mac): [Supersonic](https://github.com/dweymouth/supersonic)
